		<h1>Animated Big Data Visualization</h1>
		<h2>Animated Visualization of Frequent Itemsets as Hypergraphs</h2>

		<p>
			As a student research project at <a href="http://hsr.ch" target="_blank">HSR</a> in Switzerland in 2015
			a Proof Of Concept for animated hypergraphs was developed and released under the MIT license.

			The visualization of Big Data is a non-trivial affair. As the type of data and information
			about it are not known in advance, it is complex to find a suitable and optimal visualization
			technique. In Prof. Dr. Eduard Glatz's paper
			<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00607-013-0282-8" target="_blank">
				Visualizing big network traffic data using frequent pattern mining and hypergraphs
			</a> it was shown, that through Data Mining calculated Frequent Itemsets can efficiently be
			displayed as a hypergraph with different vertices. Although hypergraphs might no be the most
			suitable visualization technique in all cases, they provide a generic and flexible solution.

			In this student research project various layout algorithms were developed and tested in a experimental
			manner, which are suited for changes over time. Thereby are some of the most important factors
			overlapping of nodes and links and similar problems. These problems were also considered and attended to
			in the student research project.
		</p>

			The result was a layout algorithm which displays a structured hypergraph in a browser and represents the
			chronological dimension with animated toggling of visibility. Due to the use of web technologies a user can
			interact with the hypergraph and its animation, e.g. controlling the time interval. Furthermore related
			concepts where examined and documented, such as various layout algorithms and alternative, interactive
			visualization techniques.
