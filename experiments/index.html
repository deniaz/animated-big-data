		<p>
			This is the overview page for all available experiments. All of these are based on
			<a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a>. The first two make use of its Force-Directed Layout Algorithm or
			a related concept. The later two use it as an SVG/Visualization library but implement their own Layout Algorithm.

		<p>
			The <a href="animated-force-layout">Animated Force-Directed Layout</a> proves the possibility of a chronological
			animation with the chosen toolset, but has layout issues. <a href="multiple-focal-points">Multiple Focal Points</a>
			is an approach to solve these layout issues by implementing a custom variation of the force-directed layout. It works
			quite well in theory, but provides no collision detection.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="horizontally-centered">Horizontally Centered Layout</a> solves the layout issue better. The graph is
			stringently structured and reduces crossings and collisions, but is not scalable. <a href="vertically-centered">
			Vertically Centered Layout</a> attempts to solve the scalability issue by rotating the hypergraph by 90Â° and is
			the final experiment.
